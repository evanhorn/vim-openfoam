* Install the extension by using the _install_ script
> ./install
* Finished

### Change color and keywords ###
* If you have questions, hints or any suggestions please email me
* If you want to change the colors you can change the following file
> ./vim/color/*.vim
* Additionally you can copy paste one file and make your own colorscheme. To use it change it in
> ./vim/scripts.vim
* If you insert more keywords you can make a new branch or merge to the master
